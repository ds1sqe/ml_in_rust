Runner Process <- DATA(A) -- Gui Process

DATA(A) {
    Control Signal
    Initial State (Config)...
    Context
}

Runner Process -- DATA(B) -> Gui Process

DATA(B) {
    Renewed Context ?
    Costs Differences
    Nodes View
}


Runner Process Logic

1. Wait for signal (a microsec)
1.1 if there was signal,
    handle it.

2. Train (b times)

3.1.
  Create Nodes View
  Get Cost Diff
3.2.
  Clone Context
4.
  Send data.


Gui Process Logic

1. Wait for signal (c microsec)

2. if get DATA(B), rerender with that data.

<Refresh list>
2.1 Nodes view.
2.2 Gui Context (if provided)
2.3 Plot of Costs
